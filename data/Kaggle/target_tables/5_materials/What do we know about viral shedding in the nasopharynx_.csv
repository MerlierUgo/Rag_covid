The shortest observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. Among 29 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir and were discharged, the median time from illness onset to initiation of antiviral treatment was 14·0 days (IQR 10·0–17·0) and the median duration of viral shedding was 22·0 days (18·0–24·0). The median duration of viral shedding was 19·0 days (17·0–22·0) in patients with severe disease status and 24·0 days (22·0–30·0) in patients with critical disease status.",patients: 29,04/13/2020

In addition, all samples from one 58 severe patient were negative until 21 d.a.o., when feces samples were positive. The 59 median duration of virus shedding was 10.0 days (IQR 8.0 to 17.0) in nasal-throat 60 mixed swabs, but was 22.0 days (IQR 15.5 to 23.5) for the feces (Figure 1 B). The 61 viral titers of nasal-throat swabs peaked at six to nine d.a.o. and at 14-18 d.a.o for 62 fecal samples, and the highest virus titers at the peak was significantly higher for feces (105.8 copies/ml, mean 5623 copies/ml) than of respiratory samples (106.3 63 64 copies/ml, mean 2535 copies/ml) (Figure 1A).",patients: 23,04/09/2020
