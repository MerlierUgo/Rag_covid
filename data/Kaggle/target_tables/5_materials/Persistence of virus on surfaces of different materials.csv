0,2020-04-24,Isothermal evaporation rate of deposited liquid aerosols and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus survival,https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10812,arXiv,Simulation,-,Modeling,-,-,"It was shown that the main experimental results on the dynamics of coronavirus survival on various surfaces correlate well with the rate of isothermal evaporation of liquid samples with viruses on substrates which do not absorb moisture. The evaporation rate depends on the thermal conductivity and thickness of the substrate, as well as the relative humidity of the surrounding air.",model: Malthus,05-10-2020
