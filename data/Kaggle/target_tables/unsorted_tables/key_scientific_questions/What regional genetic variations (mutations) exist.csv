However, all of them had single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with respect the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence. All sequences either partial or complete, show a first common SNP mutation in the leader sequence (241C>T) which co-evolved with 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G [16]. While 3037C>T causes a synonymous mutations in nsp3 (F105F) 14408C>T and 23403A>G cause amino acid mutations in RNA primase (nsp 12, P323L), and S protein (D614G), respectively. The four co-mutations are prevalent in viral isolates from Europe. All sequences obtained in this study, but one, had 27046C (T175 in the coded M protein); one sequence from Pescara, which was not deposited with GISAID, had the mutation 27046C>T (T175M in the M protein). Moreover, 29/45 (12/16 of those which have been deposited) sequences showed R203K and G204R in the N protein as for the presence of mutations 28881G>A, 28882G>A, and 28883G>C in the nucleotide sequence. For 3/45 of sequences, the obtained sequence reads did not cover that portion of genome.",45 samples,05-24-2020

The occurrences of 8782C>T and 28144T>C coincide. 29095C>T is found in the subset of them. Both 8782C>T and 29095C>T are synonymous; however, 28144T>C causes amino acid to change L84S in ORF8. Notably, most of 8782C>T and 28144T>Cvariant substrains are found outside of Wuhan. For the 46 missense variants, 24 variants are found in ORF1ab, which is the longest ORF occupying 2/3 of the entire genome. ORF1ab is cleaved into many nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16). Among NSP's, NSP3 has more variants in the analyzed samples. All noncoding mutations are located in 5′ UTR or 3′ UTR regions. In terms of base changes, the most frequently observed one is C>T",95 genomes,05-24-2020
