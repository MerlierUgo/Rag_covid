Because of the overall low prevalence of COVID-19 in China, we did not find any significant effects of travel restrictions from China that were enacted on February 1 (Data S3). Also, we did not find significant changes to the importation risk following travel restrictions from Iran on March 1, likely because of the relatively small number of passengers arriving from that country (Data S3). Although we did find a dramatic decrease in international importation risk following the restrictions on travel from Europe (March 13), this decrease occurred after our estimates of domestic travel importation risk had already surpassed that of international importation (Figure 2E). The dramatic rises in domestic and international importation risk preceded the state-wide COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut (Figure 2E), and the recent increase in risk of domestic importation may give rise to new outbreaks in the region.","Countries: United States; State: Connecticut; Timeline: March 6-14th, 2020",05/31/2020
