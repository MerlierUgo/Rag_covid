This baseline scenario is provided only for comparison, in order to evaluate the impact of interventions, most of which are already in place in Australia. To re-iterate, we consider timely intervention scenarios applicable to the situation in Australia at the end of March 2020, in which the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed 2,000 on 24 March 2020, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence C˙ stayed above 20% for nearly two weeks prior to that. We observe that the simulated baseline generates the 20% cumulative incidence increase, in a strong agreement with actual dynamics.; while the total lockdown, that is, complete social distancing at 100%, managed to reduce the incidence and prevalence to zero, after 49 days of the mitigation. However, since the total lockdown is never perfect, we focus on the practically achievable compliance levels: 70%, 80% and 90%, with their duration set to 91 days (13 weeks), shown in Fig. 2 . Importantly, during the time period that the SD level is maintained at 70%, the disease is not controlled, with the numbers of new infected cases (incidence) remaining in hundreds, and the number of active cases (prevalence) remaining in thousands. Thus, 70% compliance is inadequate for reducing the effective reproductive number below 1.0. In contrast, the two higher levels of SD, 80% and 90%, are more effective at suppressing both prevalence and incidence during the 13-week social distancing period.",Countries: Australia; Timeline: 13 weeks,05/28/20

This is 237 expected, as disease-aware individuals with severe disease seek medical care sooner and therefore get diagnosed 238 faster causing fewer new infections as compared to the baseline model; Awareness dynamics coupled with the use 239 of self-imposed prevention measures has an even larger impact on the epidemic. The blue line in Figure 3 A shows 240 the epidemic curve for the scenario when disease-aware individuals use handwashing as self-imposed prevention 241 measure. Even if the efficacy of handwashing is modest (i.e., 30% as in Figure 3 A) the impact on the epidemic 242 can be significant, namely we predicted a 65% reduction in the peak number of diagnoses, a 29% decrease in the 243 attack rate, and a delay in peak timing of 2.7 months (Figure 3 A and B).",Countries: Netherlands; Timeline: -,05/27/20
